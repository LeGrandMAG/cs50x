# Sort Algorithm


## Time Complexity:

  - Selection sort: O(n^2) - Omega(n^2)
  - Bubble sort: O(n^2) - Omega(n)
  - Merge sort: O(n log n) - Omega(n log n)


## Sort 1: bubble or selection
  
  - on a sorted list: 0.003
  - on a random list of 5000: 0.092
  - on random list of 10000:

## sort 2 is is bubble sort
## sort 3 is selection sort


In this Lab, I had to determine what are the algorithm used in different sorting algorithms. 
There were:
- sorted list with small amount of numbers, 
- sorted list with medium amount of numbers, 
- sorted list with large amount of numbers,
- reversed list with small amount of numbers
- reversed list with medium amount of numbers
- reversed list with large amount of numbers
- random list with small amount of numbers,
- random list with medium amount of elements
- random list with large amount of numbers.

By running each lists to those algorithms, I had to see how they performed and how much time it takes all of them and decide which one was the using the bubble sort algorithm, the selection sort and the merge sort.
