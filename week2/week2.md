### Week 2: Arrays


#### Debugging:
- using debugging tool 
- rubber duck

#### Data types:

- bool : 1 byte
- char: 1 byte
- double: 8 bytes
- float: 4 bytes
- int: 4 bytes
- long: 8 bytes
- string: ? bytes 


In c when you are doing operations to return a float, at least one element need to be a float.



## Shorts:

### Scopes:

- Global variables:
- Local variables: Passed by value. The callee receive a copy of the variable not the variable itself. To solve this issue if we would like to overwrite a variable is to redefine the value in the main.


### Arrays:
 Type of data structures. Used to value of the same data types.
 Arrays are passed by reference, not by value.
 Practice what get printed out ?
 
 
 ### CLI arguments
 
 int argc
 string arcv[]: array of strings
