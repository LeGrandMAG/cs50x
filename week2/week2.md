### Week 2: Arrays


#### Debugging:
- using debugging tool 
- rubber duck

#### Data types:

- bool : 1 byte
- char: 1 byte
- double: 8 bytes
- float: 4 bytes
- int: 4 bytes
- long: 8 bytes
- string: ? bytes 


In c when you are doing operations to return a float, at least one element need to be a float.

### Scopes:

- Global variables:
- Local variables: Passed by value. The callee receive a copy of the variable not the variable itself. To solve this issue if we would like to overwrite a variable is to redefine the value in the main.
